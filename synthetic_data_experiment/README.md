There is three experiments - *i) different seeds experiment*, *ii)sample_size vs train time* and *iii)specific seed experiment*.

Every experiment has one jupyter notebook and a corresponding asset folder containing logs (checkpoints) and  graphs etc..   

## Structure
- `analysis.py`: contains utility functions for creating plots for sampling capability, noise inference (abduction) capability, counterfactuals and estimating errors 
- `cf_analysis.py`: function for permorning counterfactual prediction
-  `config.py` : important hyperparams
- `data.py` : create dataset from the data generated by the SCM.
- `full_model.py` : full model
- `partial_model.py` : partial model
- `scm.py` : True SCM
- `train.py`: script for training full model or partial model
- `utils.py` :  mkdir function (will be removed)
