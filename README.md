## On Noise Abduction for Answering Counterfactual Queries: A Practical Outlook

![Counterfactual Example](causal_graph_example.png "Counterfactual Example")

This is a PyTorch implementation of the our TMLR paper. This work builds on Pawlowski, Castro, and Glocker's [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06485) and the code in this repository is adapted from  [![rongguangw - flow-scm](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=rongguangw&message=flow-scm&color=red&logo=github)](https://github.com/rongguangw/flow-scm "Go to GitHub repo"). Pawlowski, Castro, and Glocker's code repository can be found in [![biomedia-mira - deepscm](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=biomedia-mira&message=deepscm&color=red&logo=github)](https://github.com/biomedia-mira/deepscm "Go to GitHub repo").

This repository contains the code for the paper.
