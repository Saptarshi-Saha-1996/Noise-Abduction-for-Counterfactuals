## On Noise Abduction for Answering Counterfactual Queries: A Practical Outlook

This is a PyTorch implementation of the our TMLR paper. This work builds on Pawlowski, Castro, and Glocker's [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06485) and the code in this repository is adapted from  [codebase](https://github.com/rongguangw/flow-scm). Pawlowski, Castro, and Glocker's code repository can be found in [codebase](https://github.com/biomedia-mira/deepscm).

This repository contains the code for the paper.
