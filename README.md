## On Noise Abduction for Answering Counterfactual Queries:
## A Practical Outlook
This is a PyTorch implementation of the our paper. This work builds on Pawlowski, Castro, and Glocker's [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06485) and the code in this repository is adapted from  [codebase](https://github.com/rongguangw/flow-scm).

Pawlowski, Castro, and Glocker's code repository can be found in[codebase](https://github.com/biomedia-mira/deepscm).
